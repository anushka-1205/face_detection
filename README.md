# ðŸ‘¤ Face Detection

This is a simple Python application that performs real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV's Haar cascade classifiers. It captures video from your webcam, detects faces and eyes in the frame, and highlights them with rectangles.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Real-time face detection using `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
- Eye detection within the detected face using `haarcascade_eye.xml`
- Live video feed with annotated bounding boxes
